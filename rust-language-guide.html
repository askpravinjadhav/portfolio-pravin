                <p>Rust is a modern systems programming language that has been gaining tremendous popularity in recent years. Developed by Mozilla and first released in 2010, Rust was designed to solve many of the problems that plague traditional systems programming languages like C and C++.</p>
                
                <h2>What is Rust?</h2>
                <p>Rust is a statically-typed, compiled programming language that focuses on three main goals:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Memory Safety:</strong> Prevents common bugs like null pointer dereferences, buffer overflows, and data races at compile time</li>
                    <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Offers zero-cost abstractions and performance comparable to C/C++</li>
                    <li><strong>Concurrency:</strong> Built-in support for safe concurrent programming</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Key Features of Rust</h2>
                
                <h3>1. Ownership System</h3>
                <p>Rust's unique ownership system ensures memory safety without needing a garbage collector. Here's a simple example:</p>
                
                <pre><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1; // s1 is moved to s2
    
    // println!("{}", s1); // This would cause a compile error!
    println!("{}", s2); // This works fine
}</code></pre>
                
                <h3>2. Borrowing and References</h3>
                <p>Rust uses borrowing to allow multiple references to data without taking ownership:</p>
                
                <pre><code class="language-rust">fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}

fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let len = calculate_length(&s1);
    println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s1, len);
}</code></pre>
                
                <h3>3. Pattern Matching</h3>
                <p>Rust's powerful pattern matching makes code more expressive and safe:</p>
                
                <pre><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let number = Some(5);
    
    match number {
        Some(n) => println!("The number is: {}", n),
        None => println!("No number provided"),
    }
}</code></pre>
                
                <h3>4. Error Handling</h3>
                <p>Rust uses Result and Option types for explicit error handling:</p>
                
                <pre><code class="language-rust">use std::fs::File;

fn main() {
    let file = File::open("hello.txt");
    
    match file {
        Ok(f) => println!("File opened successfully"),
        Err(e) => println!("Error opening file: {}", e),
    }
}</code></pre>
                
                <h2>Why Should You Learn Rust?</h2>
                
                <h3>1. Memory Safety Without Performance Cost</h3>
                <p>Unlike languages with garbage collectors, Rust provides memory safety guarantees at compile time without runtime overhead. This means you get the safety of managed languages with the performance of C/C++.</p>
                
                <h3>2. Growing Industry Adoption</h3>
                <p>Major companies are adopting Rust for critical systems:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Mozilla:</strong> Used in Firefox browser engine</li>
                    <li><strong>Microsoft:</strong> Rewriting Windows components in Rust</li>
                    <li><strong>Amazon:</strong> Using Rust for AWS services</li>
                    <li><strong>Google:</strong> Adopting Rust for Android development</li>
                    <li><strong>Meta:</strong> Using Rust for backend services</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>3. Excellent Tooling</h3>
                <p>Rust comes with Cargo, a powerful package manager and build tool:</p>
                
                <pre><code class="language-bash"># Create a new project
cargo new my_project

# Build the project
cargo build

# Run the project
cargo run

# Run tests
cargo test

# Format code
cargo fmt

# Check for issues
cargo clippy</code></pre>
                
                <h3>4. Strong Type System</h3>
                <p>Rust's type system catches many bugs at compile time, reducing debugging time and improving code quality:</p>
                
                <pre><code class="language-rust">// Rust won't let you compile code with type mismatches
fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}

// This would cause a compile error:
// let result = add(5, "hello"); // Error: expected i32, found &str</code></pre>
                
                <h3>5. Concurrency Made Safe</h3>
                <p>Rust's ownership system prevents data races at compile time, making concurrent programming safer:</p>
                
                <pre><code class="language-rust">use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let mut data = vec![1, 2, 3];
    
    thread::spawn(move || {
        data.push(4);
        println!("Data: {:?}", data);
    });
    
    // The compiler ensures data is safely moved to the thread
}</code></pre>
                
                <h3>6. Active and Welcoming Community</h3>
                <p>Rust has one of the friendliest and most helpful programming communities. The Rust community values:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Clear documentation</li>
                    <li>Helpful error messages</li>
                    <li>Inclusive environment</li>
                    <li>Code of conduct</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>7. WebAssembly Support</h3>
                <p>Rust is excellent for WebAssembly development, allowing you to write high-performance code that runs in browsers:</p>
                
                <pre><code class="language-rust">// Rust code can be compiled to WebAssembly
#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}</code></pre>
                
                <h2>Getting Started with Rust</h2>
